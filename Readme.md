# Task: week 2


## 1. version control 
Version control, also known as versioning or source control, is the practice of managing changes to source code. It’s about keeping a detailed account of every modification made to the code, ensuring that these changes are both trackable and reversible. A crucial tool in every developer’s kit, version control systems are the bedrock of this process.


## 2. Difference between git and github 
Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.


## 3. 3 Other github alternative 
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- codeberg    
  

 ## 3. Difference between git fetch and git pull
The difference between git fetch and git pull is that git fetch only downloads the latest changes from the remote repository, while git pull downloads the latest changes and merges them into your current branch.
Git fetch is a safer alternative because it pulls in all the commits from your remote but doesn't make any changes to your local files. On the other hand, Git pull is faster as you're performing multiple actions.


## 4. Git rebase 
The git rebase command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository. You can reorder, edit, or squash commits together. Typically, you would use git rebase to: Edit previous commit messages.
### Command for git rebase
`git rebase <base>`


## Git cherry-pick 
git cherry-pick is a powerful command that enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD. Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes.
### command for cherry-pick
`git cherry-pick`
